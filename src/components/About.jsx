            Michael Cameron's manipulated photographs, paintings, collages, and appropriated images link
            personal experiences of tragedy, loss, and queer nostalgia with fractured childhood memories.

            In 2015, Michael sustained a Traumatic Brain Injury â€” his creative process dramatically altered
            due to ensuing aphasia and paralysis. In his work, he reveals the impact of his extreme mental
            experiences.

            Michael Cameron's work is in the Robert Summers Permanent Collection of Queer Art at Cerritos
            College Art Gallery in California. He currently lives and works in Indiana.
